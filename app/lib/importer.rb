# Importer
#
# Open a CSV file, loop it, and add the results
# to the appropriate Database tables.
#
# Assumptions:
#
# 1. The CSV file is small, has headers, and the
#    data contained within it is generally correct.
#    The data is always formatted the same and
#    always using the same case.
#
# 2. Any errors hit during the import will simply
#    be skipped, there is no retrying.
#
# 3. We are never going to be dealing with BIG DATA
#    so our looping shouldn't have any negative
#    side effects.
#
# 4. However the data exists today in the CSV is how
#    the data will exist in the future. For example,
#    there are only Available At times on the hour,
#    never on the half hour or quarter hour. The Day
#    of Week values are all Capitalized, etc...
# 
# TODO: Create a solid, hardened, and extensible version.
